# USB Flashing Help for Guition ESP32-P4

Use this guide when the Espframe web installer cannot find the display, flashing fails, or the browser does not show a serial port.

## Use the Correct USB-C Port

The Guition ESP32-P4 display has two USB-C ports. For flashing Espframe, use the **bottom USB-C port** near the edge of the board and next to the USB-A connector. The upper USB-C connector is for the screen ribbon cable and will not work for flashing.

## Browser Requirements

The [Espframe installer](/install) uses Web Serial, which means you need:

- Chrome or Edge on a desktop computer.
- A USB-C data cable, not a charge-only cable.
- Permission to access the serial device when the browser asks.

Safari and Firefox do not support the required browser flashing flow.

## If No Serial Device Appears

- Check that the cable is plugged into the bottom USB-C port.
- Try a different USB-C data cable.
- Try another USB port on the computer.
- Close other tools that may already be connected to the device.
- Refresh the install page and click the install button again.

## If Flashing Starts but Fails

- Keep the browser tab open until the install completes.
- Avoid moving the cable or display during flashing.
- Disconnect and reconnect the display, then start the installer again.
- If WiFi setup does not appear after flashing, open the WiFi settings on your phone or laptop and look for a network starting with **ESP_**, such as **ESP_7A1EED**. The letters and numbers after **ESP_** come from the frame’s MAC address (its network identifier), so your frame’s name will be different. Connect to it, then visit `http://192.168.4.1` to enter your home WiFi details.

## After Flashing

When Espframe boots, connect it to WiFi and open the IP address shown on the display. Enter your Immich server URL and [API key](/api-key), then choose a [photo source](/photo-sources).
