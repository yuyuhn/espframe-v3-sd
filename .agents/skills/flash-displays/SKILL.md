description: Flash the Espframe 10-inch display firmware from this repository using ESPHome. Use when the user invokes /flash-displays, asks to flash, reflash, update, or upload firmware to the Espframe / 10-inch Guition display over its default IP address, an explicitly supplied IP address, or USB.

# Flash Display

## Overview

Use the local development ESPHome config to flash the Espframe display from this checkout. This repository has one supported device: the Guition ESP32-P4 JC8012P4A1 10.1-inch Espframe.

Flash over OTA by default using `192.168.6.106`, unless the user supplies a different IP address. Flash over USB when the user explicitly asks for USB, local USB, serial, or gives a `/dev/cu.*` target.

## Target

- Device: Guition ESP32-P4 JC8012P4A1 10.1-inch Espframe.
- ESPHome config directory: `devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1`.
- Default YAML: `dev.yaml`.
- Default OTA target: `192.168.6.106`.

## YAML Selection

Use `dev.yaml` by default. If the user names another YAML file, use that file instead.

- If the user explicitly says `dev`, `dev file`, or `dev.yaml`, use `dev.yaml`.
- If the user gives a bare filename such as `esphome.yaml`, resolve it inside the selected display's config directory.
- If the user gives a repo-relative path such as `devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1/esphome.yaml`, resolve it from the repository root.
- Only use YAML files inside this repository. If the selected file does not exist, ask for the correct file instead of guessing.
- Do not commit, print, or stage `secrets.yaml`. YAML files may reference `!secret wifi_ssid` and `!secret wifi_password`, but the secrets file itself must stay local and uncommitted. If this computer already has local secrets elsewhere, an ignored symlink may be used for local flashing.

## Workflow

1. Confirm the repository state:
   - Run `git status --short --branch`.
   - Use `main` as the source. If not on `main`, switch only when it is safe and there are no blocking local changes; otherwise explain the issue.
   - If the worktree is dirty, do not revert or commit unrelated changes. Tell the user the flash will use the current local checkout as-is.
   - If the worktree is clean, run `git pull --ff-only` before flashing.
2. Resolve the YAML file from the user's request. If none is provided, use `dev.yaml` in `devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1`.
3. Check that the selected config directory has a local `secrets.yaml` or another ESPHome-supported local secret source. If secrets are missing, stop and tell the user that WiFi credentials are needed beside the YAML before flashing.
4. Resolve the upload target:
   - Use an explicit IP address from the user's request for OTA.
   - If no target is provided and USB is not requested, use the default OTA target `192.168.6.106`.
   - Use USB when the user says `USB`, `over USB`, `serial`, `local USB`, or gives a `/dev/cu.*` device.
5. For OTA targets, check reachability first with `ping -c 2 -W 1000 <target>`.
6. For USB flashing:
   - List ports with `ls -1 /dev/cu.*`.
   - Prefer an explicit user-supplied `/dev/cu.*` target.
   - Otherwise prefer `/dev/cu.usbmodem201301` when present.
   - If that port is missing and exactly one obvious `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` port exists, use it.
   - If no clear USB modem port exists, ask the user to connect the display or choose the port.
7. Flash with the command below.
8. After an OTA flash, ping the target again. A first ping may fail during reboot; retry once after a short delay before reporting a problem.
9. Do not commit or push for flashing alone. Commit/push only if this skill or other source files were intentionally changed as part of the user request.

## Commands

Run from the device config directory:

```bash
cd /Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe/devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1
esphome -s espframe_component_url file:///Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe -s espframe_component_ref HEAD run dev.yaml --device <target> --no-logs
```

Examples:

```bash
# OTA, using the default 10-inch display IP address
cd /Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe/devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1
esphome -s espframe_component_url file:///Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe -s espframe_component_ref HEAD run dev.yaml --device 192.168.6.106 --no-logs

# USB, only when explicitly requested
cd /Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe/devices/guition-esp32-p4-jc8012p4a1
esphome -s espframe_component_url file:///Users/jtenniswood/Git/espframe -s espframe_component_ref HEAD run dev.yaml --device /dev/cu.usbmodem201301 --no-logs
```

## Reporting

Keep user updates concise:

- Say whether the display is compiling, uploading over IP, or uploading over USB.
- Mention known ESPHome warnings only if they affect the result; framework, platform, GPIO19/GPIO20, and MIPI narrowing warnings are normally non-blocking.
- Final response: say whether the display flashed successfully, or clearly identify the blocking symptom.
